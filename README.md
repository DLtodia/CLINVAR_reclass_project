# CLINVAR_reclass_project
Clinical genetic testing returns results that are categorized by testing labs into one of 5 categories:
  Benign,
  Likely benign,
  Variant of Uncertain Significance (VUS),
  Likely Pathogenic,
  Pathogenic.
These classifications can change over time. We do not know how frequently variants change classification. We do not know if     the rate at which variants are reclassified is different amongst different ancestry groups. We do not know if the rate at which variants are reclassified is different across different disease categories. The goal of this project will be to discover these differences across all of ClinVar.
